\section{Action by reductive groups}

Fix an algebraically closed field \( \kk\) of characteristic zero. 

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:category_quotient_exist_for_action_by_reductive_groups}
    Let \(G\) be a reductive group acting on a variety \(X\). 
    Then the category quotient \( \pi: X \to X/G\) exists.
    \Yang{To be checked.}
