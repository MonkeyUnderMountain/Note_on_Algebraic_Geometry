\section{Birational group of varieties of general type}

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:birational_group_of_varieties_of_general_type}
        Let \(X\) be a projective variety of general type over an algebraically closed field \(\kk\) of characteristic zero. 
        Then the group of birational automorphisms \(\Bir(X)\) is finite.
    \end{theorem}
