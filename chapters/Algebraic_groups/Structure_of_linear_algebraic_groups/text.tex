\section{Structure of linear algebraic groups}


    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:classification_of_linear_alg_gp_of_dim1}
        Let \(G\) be a linear algebraic group of dimension \(1\) over an algebraically closed field \(\kkk\). 
        Then \(G\) is isomorphic to either \(\bbG_m\) or \(\bbG_a\).
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{lemma}\label{lem:any_linear_alg_gp_has_one_dimensional_alg_subgroup}
        Let \(G\) be a linear algebraic group over an algebraically closed field \(\kkk\). 
        Then \(G\) has a one-dimensional algebraic subgroup.
    \end{lemma}
