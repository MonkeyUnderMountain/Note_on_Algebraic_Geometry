\section{First properties of algebraic groups}

Let \(\kk\) be a field and \(\kkk\) its algebraic closure. 
All varieties are defined over \(\kk\) unless otherwise specified.

\subsection{Basic concepts}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:group_scheme}
        A \emph{group scheme} over \(S\) is an \(S\)-scheme \(G\) together with morphisms \emph{multiplication} \(\mu: G \times G \to G\), \emph{identity} \(\varepsilon: S \to G\) and \emph{inversion} \(\iota: G \to G\) over \(S\) such that the following diagrams commute:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item (Associativity)
            \[
                \begin{tikzcd}
                    & G \times G \times G \arrow[rd, "\mu \times \id_G"] \arrow[ld, "\id_G \times \mu"'] & \\
                    G \times G \arrow[rd, "\mu"] & & G \times G \arrow[ld, "\mu"'] \\
                     & G & 
                \end{tikzcd};
            \]
            \item (Identity)
            \[
                \begin{tikzcd}
                    G \times S \arrow[r, "\id_G \times \varepsilon"] \arrow[rd, "\cong"'] & G \times G \arrow[d, "\mu"] & S \times G \arrow[l, "\varepsilon \times \id_G"'] \arrow[ld, "\cong"] \\
                    & G &
                \end{tikzcd};
            \]
            \item (Inversion)
            \[
                \begin{tikzcd}
                    & G \arrow[ld, "\id_G \times i"'] \arrow[rd, "i \times \id_G"] \arrow[d] & \\
                    G \times G \arrow[rd, "\mu"'] & S \arrow[d, "\varepsilon"] & G\times G\arrow[ld, "\mu"]\\
                    & G &
                \end{tikzcd}.
            \]
        \end{enumerate}
        In other words, a group scheme is a group object in the category of schemes.

    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:algebraic_group}
        An \emph{algebraic group} is a \(\kk\)-group scheme \(G\) which is reduced, separated and of finite type over a field \(\kk\).
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:transition_morphism}
        Let \(G\) be an algebraic group and \(x \in G(\kk)\) a \(\kk\)-point.
        The \emph{left translation} by \(x\) is the morphism
        \[
            l_x: G \xrightarrow{\cong} \Spec \kk \times G \xrightarrow{x \times \id_G} G \times G \xrightarrow{\mu} G.
        \]
        Similar definition applies to the right translation \(r_x\).
    \end{definition}

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:algebraic_group_is_smooth}
        Let \(G\) be an algebraic group.
        Then \(G\) is a smooth over \(\kk\).
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
        \Yang{To be continued...}
    \end{proof}

    \begin{remark}\label{rmk:irreducible_and_connected_components_of_algebraic_group}
        Let \(G\) be an algebraic group.
        Then the irreducible components of \(G\) coincide with the connected components of \(G\).
        We will use the term ``connected'' to refer to both concepts since ``irreducible'' has other meanings in the theory of representations.
    \end{remark}

    \begin{example}\label{eg:additive_group}
        The \emph{additive group} $\bbG_a$ is defined to be the affine line $\mathbb{A}^1$ with the group law given by addition.
        Concretely, we can write $\bbG_a = \Spec \kk[T]$ with the group law given by the morphism
        \begin{align*}
            \mu:\bbG_a \times \bbG_a \to \bbG_a \quad & \kk[T] \to \kk[T]\ten_\kk \kk[T], \quad T \mapsto T\ten 1 + 1 \ten T. \\
            \iota:\bbG_a \to \bbG_a \quad & \kk[T] \to \kk[T], \quad T \mapsto -T. \\
            \varepsilon:\Spec \kk \to \bbG_a \quad & \kk[T] \to \kk, \quad T \mapsto 0.
        \end{align*}
        % \Yang{To be continued...}
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}\label{eg:multiplicative_group}
        The \emph{multiplicative group} $\bbG_m$ is defined to be the affine variety $\mathbb{A}^1 \setminus \{0\}$ with the group law given by multiplication.
        Concretely, we can write $\bbG_m = \Spec \kk[T,T^{-1}]$ with the group law given by the morphism
        \begin{align*}
            \mu: \bbG_m \times \bbG_m \to \bbG_m & \leadsto \kk[T,T^{-1}] \to \kk[T,T^{-1}]\ten_\kk \kk[T,T^{-1}], \quad T \mapsto T\ten T. \\
            \iota: \bbG_m \to \bbG_m & \leadsto \kk[T,T^{-1}] \to \kk[T,T^{-1}], \quad T \mapsto T^{-1}. \\
            \varepsilon: \Spec \kk \to \bbG_m & \leadsto \kk[T,T^{-1}] \to \kk, \quad T \mapsto 1.
        \end{align*}
        % \Yang{To be continued...}
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}\label{eg:general_linear_group}
        The \emph{general linear group} $\GL_n$ is defined to be the open subvariety of $\mathbb{A}^{n^2}$ consisting of invertible matrices, with the group law given by matrix multiplication.
        Concretely, we can write \(\GL_n = \Spec \kk[T_{ij}, \det(T_{ij})^{-1}]\) where \(1 \leq i,j \leq n\) and the group law is given by the morphism
        \begin{align*}
            \mu: & \GL_n \times \GL_n \to \GL_n, \quad (A,B) \mapsto AB, \\
            \iota: & \GL_n \to \GL_n, \quad A \mapsto A^{-1}, \\
            \varepsilon: & \Spec \kk \to \GL_n, \quad 1 \mapsto I_n.
        \end{align*}
        % \Yang{To be continued...}
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}\label{eg:abelian_varieties_as_algebraic_groups}
        An abelian variety is an algebraic group that is also a proper variety.
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}\label{eg:product_of_algebraic_groups}
        Let \(G\) and \(H\) be algebraic groups.
        The \emph{product} \(G \times H\) is an algebraic group with the group law defined by
        \begin{align*}
            \mu_{G \times H} = \mu_G \times \mu_H &: (G \times H) \times (G \times H) \cong (G \times G) \times (H \times H) \to G \times H, \\   
            \varepsilon_{G \times H} = \varepsilon_G \times \varepsilon_H &: \Spec \kk \cong \Spec \kk \times \Spec \kk \to G \times H, \\
            \iota_{G \times H} = \iota_G \times \iota_H &: G \times H \to G \times H.
        \end{align*}
        %     
        % \]
        % where \(\mu_G\) and \(\mu_H\) are the group laws of \(G\) and \(H\), respectively.
        % \Yang{To be continued...}
    \end{example}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:homomorphism_of_algebraic_groups}
        A \emph{homomorphism} of algebraic groups is a morphism of schemes that is also a group homomorphism.
        Explicitly, a morphism \(f: G \to H\) between algebraic groups \(G\) and \(H\) is a homomorphism if the following diagram commutes:
        \[
            \begin{tikzcd}
                G \times G \arrow{r}{\mu_G} \arrow[d, "f\times f" swap] & G \arrow{d}{f} \\
                H \times H \arrow{r}{\mu_H} & H
            \end{tikzcd}
        \]
        where \(\mu_G\) and \(\mu_H\) are the group laws of \(G\) and \(H\), respectively.
        % \Yang{To be continued...}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:algebraic_subgroup}
        An \emph{algebraic subgroup} of an algebraic group \(G\) is a closed subscheme \(H \subseteq G\) that is also a subgroup of \(G\).
        More precisely, \(H\) is an algebraic subgroup and the inclusion morphism \(H \hookrightarrow G\) is a morphism of algebraic groups.
        % \Yang{To be continued...}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{example}\label{eg:special_linear_group}
        The \emph{special linear group} $\SL_n$ is defined to be the closed subvariety of $\GL_n$ defined by the equation \(\det = 1\).
        It is an algebraic subgroup of \(\GL_n\).
        \Yang{To be continued...}
    \end{example}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:neutral_component}
        Let \(G\) be an algebraic group.
        The \emph{neutral component} \(G^0\) is the connected component of \(G\) containing the identity element \(\varepsilon\).
        % It is a closed, normal algebraic subgroup of \(G\).
        % \Yang{To be continued...}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:neutral_component_is_subgroup}
        The neutral component \(G^0\) is a closed, normal algebraic subgroup of \(G\) of finite index.
        Moreover, each closed subgroup \(H\) of finite index contains \(G^0\).
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
        \Yang{To be continued...}
    \end{proof}

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:closure_of_subgroup_is_subgroup}
        Let \(G\) be an algebraic group and \(H \subseteq G\) a subgroup (not necessarily closed).
        Then the Zariski closure \(\overline{H}\) of \(H\) in \(G\) is an algebraic subgroup of \(G\).
        If \(H\) is constructible, then \(H = \overline{H}\).
        \Yang{To be continued...}
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
        \Yang{To be continued...}
    \end{proof}

    % \begin{remark}\label{rmk:closure_of_subgroup_is_subgroup}
    %     The assumption that \(H\) is a subgroup is essential.
    %     \Yang{To be continued...}
    % \end{remark}

    \begin{example}\label{eg:product_of_closed_algebraic_subgroups_which_is_not_closed}
        Let \(G = \SL_2\) over \(\kkk\), \(T = \{\diag(t,t^{-1})|t \in \kkk^\times\}\) and \(g = \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & 1 \\
            0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}\).
        Set \(S = gTg^{-1}\).
        Then both \(T\) and \(S\) are closed algebraic subgroups of \(G\), but the product \(TS\) is not closed in \(G\).
        By direct computation, we have
        \[ S = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix}
            s & s^{-1}-s \\
            0 & s^{-1}
        \end{pmatrix} \;\middle|\; s \in \kkk^\times \right\}.
        \]
        Then 
        \[ TS = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix}
            ts & t(s^{-1}-s) \\
            0 & (ts)^{-1}
        \end{pmatrix} \;\middle|\; t,s \in \kkk^\times \right\}.
        \]
        We have 
        \[ TS \cap \left\{ \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & a \\
            0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix} \;\middle|\; a \in \kkk \right\} = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & s^{-2}-1 \\
            0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix} \;\middle|\; s \in \kkk^\times \right\}. \]
        The right hand side is not closed in \(\SL_2\) since it does not contain the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix}
            1 & -1 \\
            0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}\).
        Hence \(TS\) is not closed in \(G\).
    \end{example}

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:generate_subgroup_by_irred_constructible_subset}
        Let \(G\) be an algebraic group, \(X_i\) varieties over \(\kk\) and \(f_i: X_i \to G\) morphisms for \(i=1,\ldots,n\) with images \(Y_i = f_i(X_i)\).
        Suppose that \(Y_i\) pass through the identity element of \(G\).
        Let \(H\) be the closed subgroup of \(G\) generated by \(Y_1,\ldots,Y_n\), i.e. the smallest closed subgroup of \(G\) containing \(Y_1,\ldots,Y_n\).
        Then \(H\) is connected and \(H = Y_{a_1}^{e_1} \cdots Y_{a_m}^{e_m}\) for some \(a_1,\ldots,a_m \in \{1,\ldots,n\}\) and \(e_1,\ldots,e_m \in \{\pm 1\}\).
    \end{proposition}

    \end{proof}

    \begin{remark}\label{rmk:generated_subgroup_by_irred_constructible_subset}
        We can take \(m \leq 2 \dim G\) in \cref{prop:generate_subgroup_by_irred_constructible_subset}.

\subsection{Action and representations}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:action_of_algebraic_group}
        An \emph{action} of an algebraic group \(G\) on a variety \(X\) is a morphism
        \[
            \sigma: G \times X \to X
        \]
        such that the following diagrams commute:
        \[
            \begin{tikzcd}
                G \times G \times X \arrow{r}{\mu \times \id_X} \arrow{d}{\id_G \times \sigma} & G \times X \arrow{d}{\sigma} \\
                G \times X \arrow{r}{\sigma} & X
            \end{tikzcd}
            \quad
            \begin{tikzcd}
                \Spec \kk \times X \arrow{r}{\varepsilon \times \id_X} \arrow{dr}[swap]{\cong} & G \times X \arrow{d}{\sigma} \\
                & X
            \end{tikzcd}
        \]
        where \(\mu\) is the group law of \(G\) and \(\varepsilon\) is the identity element of \(G\).
        In other words, for any \(\kk\)-scheme \(S\), the induced map \(G(S) \times X(S) \to X(S)\) defines a group action of the abstract group \(G(S)\) on the set \(X(S)\).
        We say that \(X\) is a \emph{\(G\)-variety}.
        \Yang{To be checked.}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:basic_concepts_in_group_action}
        Let \(G\) be an algebraic group acting on a variety \(X\).
        For any field extension \(K/\kk\) and \(x \in X(K)\), the \emph{orbit} of \(x\) is the subset
        \[
            G(K) \cdot x = \{\sigma(g,x) | g \in G(K)\} \subseteq X(K).
        \]
        The \emph{stabilizer} of \(x\) is the subgroup
        \[
            G_x(K) = \{g \in G(K) | \sigma(g,x) = x\} \subseteq G(K).
        \]
        The action is called \emph{transitive} if for any field extension \(K/\kk\), the induced map \(G(K) \times X(K) \to X(K)\) is transitive.
        The action is called \emph{faithful} if for any field extension \(K/\kk\), the induced map \(G(K) \times X(K) \to X(K)\) is faithful.
        \Yang{To be checked.}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{example}\label{eg:linear_representation}
        A \emph{linear representation} of an algebraic group \(G\) on a finite-dimensional vector space \(V = \bbA_\kk^k\) over \(\kk\) is an action of \(G\) on the affine space associated to \(V\), i.e. a morphism
        \[
            \rho: G \times V \to V
        \]
        such that for any field extension \(K/\kk\), the induced map \(G(K) \times V(K) \to V(K)\) defines a group homomorphism from the abstract group \(G(K)\) to the general linear group of the vector space \(V(K)\).
        In other words, for any \(g \in G(K)\), the map \(\rho_g: V(K) \to V(K)\) defined by \(\rho_g(v) = \rho(g,v)\) is a linear automorphism of \(V(K)\).
        We say that \(V\) is a \(G\)-module.
        \Yang{To be checked.}
    \end{example}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:rational_group_actions}
        An \emph{rational action} of an algebraic group \(G\) on a variety \(X\) is a rational map
        \[
            \sigma: G \times X \dashrightarrow X
        \]
        such that the following diagrams commute wherever the maps are defined:
        \[
            \begin{tikzcd}
                G \times G \times X \arrow{r}{\mu \times \id_X} \arrow[dashed]{d}{\id_G \times \sigma} & G \times X \arrow[dashed]{d}{\sigma} \\
                G \times X \arrow[dashed]{r}{\sigma} & X     
            \end{tikzcd}
            \quad
            \begin{tikzcd}
                \Spec \kk \times X \arrow{r}{\varepsilon \times \id_X} \arrow{dr}[swap]{\cong} & G \times X \arrow{d}{\sigma} \\
                & X
            \end{tikzcd}
        \]
        where \(\mu\) is the group law of \(G\) and \(\varepsilon\) is the identity element of \(G\).
        In other words, for any field extension \(K/\kk\), the induced map \(G(K) \times X(K) \dashrightarrow X(K)\) defines a group action of the abstract group \(G(K)\) on the set \(X(K)\).
        We say that \(X\) is a \emph{rational \(G\)-variety}.

    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:orbit_of_algebraic_group_action}
        Let \(G\) be an algebraic group acting on a variety \(X\).
        For any \(x \in X(\kk)\), the \emph{orbit} of \(x\) is the locally closed subvariety \(G \cdot x = \sigma(G \times \{x\})\) of \(X\).
        Note that this definition is different from the one in \cref{def:basic_concepts_in_group_action}.

        Let \(G\) be an algebraic group acting on a variety \(X\).
        Then there exists a variety \(Y\) with a regular action of \(G\) and a \(G\)-equivariant birational isomorphism \(X \dashrightarrow Y\).
        % In other words, any rational action of an algebraic group on a variety can be regularized.

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:orbit_is_locally_closed}
        Let \(G\) be an algebraic group acting on a variety \(X\).
        Then for any \(x \in X(\kk)\), the orbit \(G \cdot x\) is a locally closed subvariety of \(X\), and \(\overline{G \cdot x} \setminus G \cdot x \) is a union of orbits of strictly smaller dimension.
        % Moreover, the morphism \(G/G_x \to G \cdot x\) induced by the action is an isomorphism, where \(G_x\) is the stabilizer of \(x\).
        % In particular, if \(G\) is smooth, then \(G \cdot x\) is smooth.

\subsection{Affine algebraic groups}

    Let \(G\) be an algebraic group acting on an affine variety \(X = \Spec A\).
    For \(x \in G(\kk)\), we have the left translation of functions \(\tau_x: A \to A\) defined by \(\tau_x(f)(y) = f(x^{-1}y)\) for \(y \in X(\kk)\).

    \begin{lemma}\label{lem:finite_dimensional_invariant_subspace}
        Let \(G\) be an algebraic group acting on an affine variety \(X = \Spec A\).
        For any finite-dimensional subspace \(V \subseteq A\), there exists a finite-dimensional \(G\)-invariant subspace \(W \subseteq A\) containing \(V\).
        % In other words, any finite-dimensional subspace of \(A\) is contained in a finite-dimensional \(G\)-invariant subspace of \(A\).
