\section{Decomposition of algebraic groups}

    \begin{theorem}[Chavellaye Decomposition]\label{thm:Chavellaye_decomposition}
        Let \(G\) be an algebraic group.
        Then there exists a unique maximal connected affine normal algebraic subgroup \(G_{\text{aff}}\) of \(G\) such that the quotient \(G/G_{\text{aff}}\) is an abelian variety.
        This subgroup is called the \emph{affine part} of \(G\).

    \end{theorem}

    \begin{theorem}[Rosenlicht Decomposition]\label{thm:Rosenlicht_decomposition}
        Let \(G\) be an algebraic group.
        Then there exists a smallest normal connected algebraic subgroup \(G_{\text{ant}}\) of \(G\) such that the quotient \(G/G_{\text{ant}}\) is affine.
        This subgroup is called the \emph{anti-affine part} of \(G\).
        Moreover, \(G_{\text{ant}}\) is contained in the center of \(G^0\).
