\section{Derived Functors}

In this section, fix an abelian category \(\cala\).

\subsection{Resolution}

    \begin{definition}[Resolution]
        Let \(A \in \cala\).
        A \emph{projective resolution} (resp. \emph{flat resolution, free resolution}) of \(A\) is an exact sequence
        \[ \cdots \to P_n \to P_{n-1} \to \cdots \to P_1 \to P_0 \to A \to 0,\]
        where each \(P_i\) is a projective (resp. flat, free) object in \(\cala\).
        
        An \emph{injective resolution} of \(A\) is an exact sequence
        \[ 0 \to A \to I^0 \to I^1 \to I^2 \to \cdots \to I^n \to \cdots, \]
        where each \(I^i\) is an injective object in \(\cala\).
    \end{definition}

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop: morphism induces morphism of resolution complexes}
        Let \(P_\bullet: \cdots \to P_1 \to P_0 \to A \to 0\) and \(Q_\bullet: \cdots \to Q_1 \to Q_0 \to B \to 0\) be complexes in \(\cala\) such that \(P_i\) is projective and \(Q_\bullet\) is exact. 
        Given a morphism \(f: A \to B\), there exists a morphism of complexes \(f_\bullet: P_\bullet \to Q_\bullet\) such that \(f_0 = f\).
        In particular, any two such morphism of complexes are homotopic.

        Dually, let \(I^\bullet: 0 \to A \to I^0 \to I^1 \to \cdots\) and \(J^\bullet: 0 \to B \to J^0 \to J^1 \to \cdots\) be complexes in \(\cala\) such that \(J^i\) is injective and \(I^\bullet\) is exact.
        Given a morphism \(f: A \to B\), there exists a morphism of complexes \(f^\bullet: I^\bullet \to J^\bullet\) such that \(f^0 = f\).
        In particular, any two such morphism of complexes are homotopic.
    \end{proposition}

        \Yang{To be completed.}
    \end{proof}

    \begin{definition}
        For an object \(A \in \cala\), the \emph{projective dimension} of \(A\), denoted \(\projdim A\), 
        is the smallest integer \(n\) such that there exists a projective resolution
        \[ 0 \to P_n \to P_{n-1} \to \cdots \to P_1 \to P_0 \to A \to 0\] 
        of \(A\) of length \(n\).
        If no such \(n\) exists, we set \(\projdim A = \infty\).
        
        Dually, the \emph{injective dimension} of \(A\), denoted \(\injdim A\), 
        is the smallest integer \(n\) such that there exists an injective resolution 
        \[ 0 \to A \to I^0 \to I^1 \to \cdots \to I^{n-1} \to I^n \to 0\]
        of \(A\) of length \(n\).
        If no such \(n\) exists, we set \(\injdim A = \infty\).
    \end{definition}
