\section{Setup and the first examples}

\begin{example}
    Let $\kkk$ be an algebraically closed field and $A$ the localization of $\kkk[x]$ at $(x)$.
    Let $S = \Spec A$ and $X = \Spec A[y]$. 
    There are three types of points in $X$:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item closed points with residue field $\kkk$, like $p = (x,y-a)$;
        \item closed points with residue field $\kkk(y)$, like $P = (xy-1)$;
        \item non-closed points, like $\eta_1 = (x),\eta_2 = (y),\eta_3 = (x-y)$.
    \end{enumerate}

\end{example}
