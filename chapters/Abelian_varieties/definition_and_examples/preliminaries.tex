\begin{proposition}\label{prop:upper semicontinuity of fiber dimension}
    Let \(f: X \to Y\) be a morphism of varieties over a field \(\kk\).
    Then the function \(y \mapsto \dim f^{-1}(y)\) is upper semicontinuous, i.e., for every integer \(m\), the set \(\{y \in Y: \dim f^{-1}(y) \geq m\}\) is closed in \(Y\).
    \Yang{To be check.}

\begin{theorem}[Rigidity Lemma]\label{thm:Rigidity_Lemma}
    Let \(\pi_i: X \to Y_i\) be proper morphisms of varieties over a field \(\kk\) for \(i=1,2\).
    Suppose that \(\pi_1\) is a fibration and \(\pi_2\) contracts \(\pi_1^{-1}(y_0)\).
    Then there exists a rational map \(\varphi: Y_1 \ratmap Y_2\) such that \(\pi_2 \circ \varphi = \pi_1\) and \(\varphi\) is well-defined near \(Y_1 \setminus \{y_0\}\).
