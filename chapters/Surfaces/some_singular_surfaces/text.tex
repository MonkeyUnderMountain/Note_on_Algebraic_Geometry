\section{Some Singular Surfaces}

In this section, fix an algebraically closed field \(\kkk\).
Everything is over \(\kkk\) unless otherwise specified.

\subsection{Projective cone over smooth projective curve}

    Let \(C \subset \bbP^n\) be a smooth projective curve.
    The \emph{projective cone} over \(C\) is the projective variety \(X \subset \bbP^{n+1}\) defined by the same homogeneous equations as \(C\).
    The variety \(X\) is singular at the vertex of the cone, which corresponds to the point \([0:\cdots:0:1]\in \bbP^{n+1}\).
