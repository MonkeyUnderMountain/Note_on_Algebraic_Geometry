\section{Birational geometry on surfaces}

Let \(\kkk\) be an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic.
Unless otherwise specified, all varieties are defined over \(\kkk\).

\subsection{Castelnuovo's Theorem and Run the MMP}

    \begin{theorem}[Castelnuovo's contractibility criterion]\label{thm:castelnuovo_contractibility_criterion}
        Let \(X\) be a smooth projective surface over an algebraically closed field \(\kkk\).
        Let \(C\subseteq X\) be an irreducible curve.
        Then there exists a birational morphism \(f:X\to Y\) contracting \(C\) to a smooth point if and only if \(C\cong \bbP^1\) and \(C^2=-1\).
    \end{theorem}
