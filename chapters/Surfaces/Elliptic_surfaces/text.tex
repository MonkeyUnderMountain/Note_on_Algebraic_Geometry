    \begin{definition}\label{def:elliptic_surface}
        An \emph{elliptic surface} is a smooth projective surface \(S\) together with a surjective morphism \(\pi:S\to C\) to a smooth projective curve \(C\) such that the generic fiber of \(\pi\) is a smooth curve of genus 1, and \(\pi\) has a section \(s:C\to S\).
