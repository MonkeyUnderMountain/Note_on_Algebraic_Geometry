\section{Varieties in more general settings}
\subsection{Varieties}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:variety_over_algebraically_closed_field}
        A \emph{variety} over an algebraically closed field \(\kkk\) is an integral separated scheme of finite type over \(\Spec \kk\).
    \end{definition}

    \Yang{Suppose that \(\kk\) is not algebraically closed, let \(\kk'\) be an algebraic extension of \(\kk\).
    What is the relation between \(X\), \(X_{\kk'}\), \(X(\kk')\) and \(X_{\kk'}(\kk')\)?}


\subsection{Geometric properties}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:geometrically_property}
        Let \(\kk\) be a field and \(X\) a separated scheme of finite type over \(\Spec \kk\).
        We say that \(X\) has a \emph{geometric property} \(\calP\) if \(X_{\kkk}\) has the property \(\calP\) for the algebraic closure \(\kkk\) of \(\kk\).
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:varieties_over_general_field}
        A \emph{variety} over a field \(\kk\) is a separated geometrically integral scheme of finite type over \(\Spec \kk\).
    \end{definition}


\subsection{Points in varieties}

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:points_in_varieties_and_extension_of_base_field}
        Let \(\calk\) be a field and \(\call\) an extension of \(\calk\).
        Let \(X\) be a variety over \(\calk\).
        Then we have the following:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item there is a natural bijection between \(X(\call)\) and \(X_\call(\call)\);
            \item let \(\calm/\call\) be an extension, then there is a natural inclusion \(X(\call) \subseteq X(\calm)\);
            \item suppose that \(X = \Spec \calk[T_1,\ldots,T_n]/I\) is an affine variety, then there is a natural bijection between \(X(\call)\) and the set \(\{(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in \call^n | f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = 0, \forall f \in I\}\).
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{proposition}
