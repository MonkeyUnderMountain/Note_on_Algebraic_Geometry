\section{Finite morphisms and fibrations}

    \begin{theorem}[Zariski's Main Theorem]\label{thm:Zariski_main_theorem}
        Let \(f: Y \to X\) be a quasi-finite and separated morphism of schemes.
        Then there exists a factorization
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{theorem}[Stein factorization]\label{thm:Stein_factorization}
        Let \(f: Y \to X\) be a proper morphism of noetherian schemes.
        Then there exists a factorization
        \[
            Y \xrightarrow{g} Z \xrightarrow{h} X,
        \]
        where \(g\) is a proper morphism with connected fibers and \(h\) is a finite morphism.
        Moreover, this factorization is unique up to isomorphism.

\subsection{Finite morphisms}

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:finite_preserve_ampleness}
        Let \(f: Y \to X\) be a finite morphism of schemes. 
        If \(\calL\) is an ample line bundle on \(X\), then \(f^*\calL\) is an ample line bundle on \(Y\).
        If and only if.
    \end{theorem}

\subsection{Fibrations}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:fibration_of_proper_morphism}
        Let \(f: Y \to X\) be a proper morphism of noetherian schemes.
        We say that \(f\) is a fibration if for every point \(x \in X\), the fiber \(f^{-1}(x)\) is a geometrically connected scheme.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:fibration_direct_image_of_O_Y_and_algebraically_closed_in_function_field}
        Let \(f: Y \to X\) be a proper morphism of noetherian schemes.
        Then \(f\) is a fibration if and only if the natural map \(\calO_X \to f_*\calO_Y\) is an isomorphism.
        In particular, if \(X\) is an algebraically closed field and \(f\) is a fibration, then the fibers \(f^{-1}(x)\) are also algebraically closed in the function field \(K(X)\).
        \Yang{To be revised}
    \end{proposition}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:fibration_of_rational_map}
        Let \(f: Y \dashrightarrow X\) be a rational map of noetherian schemes.
        We say that \(f\) is a fibration if there exists an open subset \(U \subseteq Y\) such that the restriction \(f|_U : U \to X\) is a fibration.
    \end{definition}
