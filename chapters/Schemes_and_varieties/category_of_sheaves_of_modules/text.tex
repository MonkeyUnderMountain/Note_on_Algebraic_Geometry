\subsection{Sheaves of modules, quasi-coherent and coherent sheaves}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:sheaf_of_modules}
        Let \((X,\calO_X)\) be a ringed space.
        A \emph{sheaf of \(\calO_X\)-modules} is a sheaf \(\calF\) of abelian groups on \(X\) such that for every open set \(U\subseteq X\), 
        \(\calF(U)\) is an \(\calO_X(U)\)-module, 
        and for every inclusion of open sets \(V\subseteq U\), the restriction map \(\res_{UV}:\calF(U)\to \calF(V)\) is \(\calO_X(U)\)-linear, 
        where the \(\calO_X(U)\)-module structure on \(\calF(V)\) is induced by the restriction map \(\res_{UV}:\calO_X(U)\to \calO_X(V)\).

        A \emph{morphism of \(\calO_X\)-modules} is a morphism of sheaves of abelian groups \(\varphi:\calF\to \calG\) such that 
        for every open set \(U\subseteq X\), the map \(\varphi(U):\calF(U)\to \calG(U)\) is \(\calO_X(U)\)-linear.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:quasi-coherent_sheaf}
        Let \((X,\calO_X)\) be a ringed space.
        An \(\calO_X\)-module \(\calF\) is called \emph{quasi-coherent} if for every point \(x\in X\), there exists an open neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\) such that \(\calF|_U\) is isomorphic to the cokernel of a morphism of free \(\calO_U\)-modules, i.e., there exists an exact sequence of sheaves of \(\calO_U\)-modules
        \[
            \calO_U^{(I)} \to \calO_U^{(J)} \to \calF|_U \to 0,
        \]
        where \(I,J\) are (possibly infinite) index sets.

    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:finitely_generated_sheaf}
        Let \((X,\calO_X)\) be a ringed space.
        An \(\calO_X\)-module \(\calF\) is called \emph{finitely generated} if for every point \(x\in X\), there exists an open neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\) such that there exists a surjective morphism of sheaves of \(\calO_U\)-modules
        \[
            \calO_U^n \to \calF|_U \to 0.
        \]
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:coherent_sheaf}
        Let \((X,\calO_X)\) be a ringed space.
        An \(\calO_X\)-module \(\calF\) is called \emph{coherent} if it is finitely generated, and for every open set \(U\subseteq X\) and every morphism of sheaves of \(\calO_U\)-modules \(\varphi:\calO_U^n \to \calF|_U\), the kernel of \(\varphi\) is finitely generated.
        % \Yang{To be checked...}
