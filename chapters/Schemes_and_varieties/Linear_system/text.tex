    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:morphism_to_projective_space}
        Let \(A\) be a ring and \(X\) an \(A\)-scheme.
        Let \(\calL\) be a line bundle on \(X\) and \(s_0,\ldots,s_n\in\Gamma(X,\calL)\).
        Suppose that \(\{s_i\}\) generate \(\calL\), i.e., \(\bigoplus_i \calO_X s_i \to \calL\) is surjective.
        Then there is a unique morphism \(f:X\to \bbP^n_A\) such that \(\calL\cong f^*\calO(1)\) and \(s_i=f^*x_i\), where \(x_i\) are the standard coordinates on \(\bbP^n_A\).
