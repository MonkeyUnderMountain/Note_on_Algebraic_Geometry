    \begin{example}\label{eg:presheaves_as_category_fibered_in_set}
        Let \(\bfS\) be a category and \(\calF: \bfS^{op} \to \Set\) be a presheaf on \(\bfS\) taking values in \(\Set\).
        We can construct a category \(\bfF\) fibred over \(\bfS\) as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The objects of \(\bfF\) are pairs \((U, x)\) where \(U \in \Obj(\bfS)\) and \(x \in \calF(U)\);
            \item morphisms from \((V, y)\) to \((U, x)\) in \(\bfF\) are morphisms \(\iota: V \to U\) in \(\bfS\) such that \(\calF(\iota)(x) = y\),
                denoted by \(\res_{\iota}\).
        \end{itemize}
        The functor \(\bfp: \bfF \to \bfS\) is defined by \(\bfp(U, x) = U\) on objects and \(\bfp(\iota) = \iota\) on morphisms.
        If one has the diagram
        \[ \begin{tikzcd}
            (W, z)  \arrow[rrd,bend left,"\res_{\tau}"] \arrow[dd, mapsto] & & \\
                    & (V, y) \arrow[d,mapsto] \arrow[r, "\res_{\iota}"] & (U, x) \arrow[d,mapsto] \\
            W \arrow[r, "\sigma"] & V \arrow[r, "\iota"] & U
        \end{tikzcd} \]
        with \(\bfp(\res_{\tau}) = \iota \circ \sigma\).
        By definition, we have \(\tau = \iota \circ \sigma\) and \(\calF(\tau)(x) = z\),\(\calF(\iota)(x) = y\).
        Thus, we have \(\calF(\sigma)(y) = z\).
        This verifies that \(\res_{\sigma}\) is a strongly Cartesian morphism.
        Note that the fiber of \(\bfF\) over an \(U \in \Obj(\bfS)\) is the discrete category associated to the set \(\calF(U)\).
        Therefore, presheaves of sets can be viewed as categories fibred in sets.

        Conversely, given a category \(\bfF\) fibred in sets over \(\bfS\) via \(\bfp: \bfF \to \bfS\),
        one can construct a presheaf of sets \(\calF: \bfS^{op} \to \Set\) by defining \(\calF(U) = \Obj(\bfF_U)\) for each \(U \in \Obj(\bfS)\),
        and for each morphism \(\iota: V \to U\) in \(\bfS\), defining \(\calF(\iota): \calF(U) \to \calF(V)\) by sending an object \(x \in \calF(U)\) to its pullback \(\iota^*x \in \calF(V)\) along \(\iota\).
        This establishes an equivalence between presheaves of sets on \(\bfS\) and categories fibred in sets over \(\bfS\).
