\section{Introduction to moduli problems}


\subsection{Moduli problem}
    
    Moduli space is a geometric space whose points represent isomorphism classes of certain geometric objects.
    For example, fix a field \(\kkk\), all elliptic curves over \(\kkk\) can be classified by the \(j\)-invariant, which gives a bijection between isomorphism classes of elliptic curves and elements of \(\kkk\).
