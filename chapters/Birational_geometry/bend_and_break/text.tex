\subsection{Preliminary}

    \begin{definition}[Frobinius morphism]\label{def:Frobinius_morphism}
        Let \(X\) be a variety over a field \(\kkk\) of characteristic \(p > 0\).
        Denote the structure morphism by \(\pi: X \to \Spec \kkk\).
        The \emph{absolute Frobenius morphism} is the morphism given by \(\calo_X \to \calo_X, f \mapsto f^p\), denoted by \(\Frob_{X/\bbf_p}\).
        The \emph{relative Frobenius morphism} is the morphism \(\Frob_{X/\kkk}\) given by the following commutative diagram:
        \[ \xymatrix{
            X \ar@/^/[rrd]^{\Frob_{X/\bbf_p}}  \ar@/_/[ddr]_\pi \ar[rd]|{\Frob_{X/\kkk}}  &   & \\
                & X\times_{\kkk} \Spec \kkk \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d]^\pi \\
                & \Spec \kkk \ar[r]^{\Frob_{\kkk/\bbf_p}} &  \Spec \kkk
        }. \] 
        We usually denote \(X \times_{\kkk} \Spec \kkk\) appearing above by \(X^{(p)}\).
    \end{definition}

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:relative_frobinius_is_finite_of_degree_p^d}
        Let \(X\) be a variety of dimension \(d\) over a field \(\kkk\) of characteristic \(p > 0\).
        Then the relative Frobenius morphism \(\Frob_{X/\kkk}: X \to X^{(p)}\) is a finite morphism of degree \(p^d\) over \(\kkk\).
    \end{proposition}

\subsection{Deformation of curves}

    \begin{theorem}[{ref. \cite[Chapter II, Theorem 1.2]{Kol96}}]\label{thm:dimension_of_deformation_space_of_curves}
        Let \(C\) be a projective smooth curve of genus \(g\) and \(X\) a smooth projective variety of dimension \(n\).
        Let \(f:C \to X\) be a non-constant morphism.
        Then every irreducible component of \(\Mor(C, X)\) containing \(f\) has dimension at least
        \[ -K_Y\cdot f(C) + (1-g)n. \]
    \end{theorem}

\subsection{Find rational curves}

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:rational_curve_on_smooth_fano}
        Let \(X\) be a smooth Fano variety.
        Then for any \(x \in X(\kkk)\), there is a rational curve \(C\) passing through \(x\) with 
        \[ 0 < - C \cdot K_X \leq \dim X + 1. \]
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:rational_curve_on_smooth_variety_with_not_nef_K}
        Let \(X\) be a smooth projective variety such that \(K_X \cdot C < 0\) for some irreducible curve \(C \subset X\).
        Let \(H\) be an ample divisor on \(X\).
        Then there exists a rational curve \(\Gamma\) such that
        \[ -(K_X \cdot C) \cdot \frac{H\cdot \Gamma}{H \cdot C} \leq -K_X \cdot \Gamma \leq \dim X + 1. \]
    \end{theorem}
