\section{Iitaka fibration}

    \begin{theorem}[{Iitaka fibration, ref. \cite[Theorem2.1.33]{Laz04a}}]\label{thm:Iitaka_fibration}
        Let \( X \) be a normal projective variety, and \( L \) a line bundle on \( X \) such that \( \kappa(X,L) > 0 \). Then for all sufficiently large \( k \in N(X,L) \), the rational mappings \( \phi_k : X \rightarrow Y_k \) are birationally equivalent to a fixed algebraic fibre space
        \[
        \phi_{\infty} : X_{\infty} \rightarrow Y_{\infty}
        \]
        of normal varieties, and the restriction of \( L \) to a very general fibre of \( \phi_{\infty} \) has Iitaka dimension \( = 0 \). More specifically, there exists for large \( k \in N(X,L) \) a commutative diagram
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
        X \arrow[d, "\phi_k"'] \arrow[r, dashed, "u_{\infty}"] & X_{\infty} \arrow[d, "\phi_{\infty}"] \\
        Y_k \arrow[r, dashed, "\nu_k"'] & Y_{\infty}
        \end{tikzcd}
        \]
        of rational maps and morphisms, where the horizontal maps are birational and \( u_{\infty} \) is a morphism. One has \(\dim Y_{\infty} = \kappa(X,L)\). Moreover, if we set \( L_{\infty} = u^{*}_{\infty}L \), and take \( F \subseteq X_{\infty} \) to be a very general fibre of \( \phi_{\infty} \), then
        \[
        \kappa(F, L_{\infty} | F) = 0.
        \]
        More precisely, the assertion is that the last displayed formula holds for the fibres of \( \phi_{\infty} \) over all points in the complement of the union of countably many proper subvarieties of \( Y_{\infty} \).
    \end{theorem}
