\subsection{Grothendieck topology}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:Grothendieck_topology_and_site}
        Let \(\bfC\) be a category.
        A \emph{Grothendieck topology} on \(\bfC\) is a collection of sets of arrows \(\{U_i \to U\}_{i \in I}\), called \emph{covering}, for each object \(U\) in \(\bfC\) such that:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item if \(V \to U\) is an isomorphism, then \(\{V \to U\}\) is a covering;
            \item if \(\{U_i \to U\}_{i \in I}\) is a covering and \(V \to U\) is a arrow, then the fiber product \(U_i \times_U V \to V\) exists and \(\{U_i \times_U V \to V\}\) is a covering of \(V\);
            \item if \(\{U_i \to U\}_{i \in I}\) and \(\{U_{ij} \to U_{i}\}_{j \in J_i}\) are coverings, then the collection of composition \(\{U_{ij} \to U_i \to U\}_{i\in I, j\in J_i}\) is a covering.
        \end{enumerate}
        A \emph{site} is a pair \((\bfC, \calj)\) where \(\bfC\) is a category and \(\calj\) is a Grothendieck topology on \(\bfC\).
    \end{definition}

    Note that sheaf is indeed defined on a site.

    \begin{definition}\label{def:sheaves_on_site}
        Let \((\bfC, \calj)\) be a site.
        A \emph{sheaf} on \((\bfC, \calj)\) is a functor \(\calF: \bfC^{op} \to \Set\) satisfying the following condition:
        for every object \(U\) in \(\bfC\) and every covering \(\{U_i \to U\}_{i \in I}\) of \(U\), 
        if we have a collection of elements \(s_i \in \calF(U_i)\) such that for every \(i,j\), 
        the pullback \(s_i|_{U_i \times_U U_j}\) and \(s_j|_{U_i \times_U U_j}\) are equal, 
        then there exists a unique element \(s \in \calF(U)\) such that for every \(i\), the pullback \(s|_{U_i} = s_i\).
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:big_etale_site}
        Let \(X\) be a scheme.
        The \emph{big \'etale site} of \(X\), denoted by \((\Sch/X)_{\text{\'et}}\), is the category of schemes over \(X\) with the Grothendieck topology generated by \'etale morphisms,
        that is, a collection of morphisms \(\{U_i \to U\}_{i \in I}\) is a covering if and only if each \(U_i\) is \'etale over \(U\) and the union of their images is the whole \(U\).
    \end{definition}

    Let \(X\) be a scheme over \(S\).
    By Yoneda's Lemma, it is equivalent to give a functor \(h_X: \Sch_S^{op} \to \Set\) such that for any \(S\)-scheme \(T\), \(h_X(T) = \Hom_{\Sch_S}(T, X)\).
    \Yang{Easy to check that \(h_X\) is a sheaf on the big \'etale site \((\Sch/S)_{\text{\'et}}\).}
